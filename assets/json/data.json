Using Ember.js as our framework, I pull data from the database using models and custom Ajax calls to the backend. The data is then bound to the frontend templates using handlebars for templating and sass for styling. Since I started on the team, we have moved from being an internal application to offering services to external clients in a range of industries. Our first client was on boarded in October 2018 and the team continues to move toward acquiring new clients. ",
